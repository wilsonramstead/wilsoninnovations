      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        At CoreX, we value your privacy. We collect only what we need to operate our app and features (e.g., classes/RSVPs, social posts, DMs, goals, leaderboards). We do not sell your personal data.
      </p>

      <h3>Data We Collect</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Account Data:</strong> name, username, email, profile details (e.g., avatar), studio/gym membership.</li>
        <li><strong>Content You Provide:</strong> goals, posts, comments, likes, messages, RSVPs, profile info, and media you upload. Access to photos is limited to items you explicitly select.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage & Device Data:</strong> app interactions, device type, OS/version, app version, language, time zone, crash logs, and diagnostics.</li>
        <li><strong>Studio/Transaction Context:</strong> when a studio integrates third-party payments or links, we may process non-sensitive metadata needed to reflect subscription status. Payment processing is handled by third-party providers and never stored as full card data by CoreX.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How We Use Data</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide core features (scheduling, RSVPs, social feed, messaging, leaderboards, goals).</li>
        <li>Secure accounts, prevent abuse, and enforce our policies.</li>
        <li>Improve reliability, performance, and user experience.</li>
        <li>Communicate important updates, security notices, or support responses.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Data Sharing</h3>
      <p>
        We may share data with service providers solely to operate the app (e.g., authentication, databases, file storage, analytics, crash reporting, push notifications, email delivery). These providers are required to protect your data and use it only to provide services to CoreX.
      </p>

      <h3>Retention</h3>
      <p>
        We retain data for as long as you maintain an account or as needed to provide the app, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. You may request deletion (see below).
      </p>

      <h3 id="privacy-requests">Your Rights & Choices</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Access/Export:</strong> Request a copy of your data.</li>
        <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> Request deletion of your account and associated content (subject to lawful and operational limits, e.g., security logs).</li>
        <li><strong>Correction:</strong> Update your profile details within the app.</li>
        <li><strong>Permissions:</strong> You can revoke device permissions (e.g., Photos) in your OS settings.</li>
      </ul>
